# Ai-Core Service
<hr>
<br>
This is a small service that uses spring-ai and llama3 to save a pdf file in
a pgvector database and answer questions about that pdf file
<br>
The app is constructed using Spring Framework 6 Spring Boot 3.2.5
Angular 18. The entire app is deployed as a single jar, including the Angular 18 part.
The app is using Angular 18 CSR with standalone components. At build time 
the index.html file is created and put in the /resources/browse directory, and at runtime 
the static index.html file generated by Angular 18 is served by the Spring Boot app.
